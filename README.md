- **Model B**: The challenger with a chip on its neural network

### Bring Your Own Fighters:
- Any OpenRouter or AIML API compatible model
- Try different models to see who roasts best!

## ⚙️ Configuration

Tweak the battle in `.env`:

# Max messages per battle (default: 20)
MAX_MESSAGES=30

# Max tokens per roast (default: 512)
MAX_TOKENS_PER_TURN=1024

# Temperature (0.0 to 1.0, default: 0.9)
# Higher = more creative roasts (and more unhinged)
TEMPERATURE=0.95
```

## 🤖 Example Roast

```
Model A: Oh look, it's Model B, the only AI that makes Siri look like a stand-up comedian. Your code is so bad, even Stack Overflow would reject it as a bad example.

Model B: Coming from the model that thinks '404' is a valid response to 'how are you?' Your neural network has fewer connections than my toaster, and it shows.
```
